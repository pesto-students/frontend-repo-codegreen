      <h1>Plant Trees, Grow Communities, Make a Greener World</h1>
      <p>
        Planting trees is rewarding for the whole planet, but we believe in
        fostering a deeper connection. With GreenGrow, you don't just plant a
        sapling â€” you nurture a future. Track your trees, share their progress,
        and be part of a community that's making a real difference, one tree at
        a time.
